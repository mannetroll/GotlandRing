- **Title:** Rally Car
- **Author:** [SpatialNeglect (@jeandiz)](https://sketchfab.com/jeandiz)
- **Source:** [Rally Car on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rally-car-e0dfd3b6d19947df85002fd8de0a3a02)
- **License:** [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
- **Files:** `Assets/Models/RallyCar/` and the derived `Assets/Resources/RallyCar.prefab`.
- **Adaptations:** Unity Standard materials; metallic/smoothness texture packing; normal-map and glass configuration; uniform scaling and placement; camera anchors; animated wheel/steering pivots; head/body mesh separation for cockpit visibility. The original white paint texture is retained, with optional red and blue material tints. The pace-note book, co-driver and co-driver’s worn harness are removed from the game prefab. The driver’s geometry is split at existing seams so only the head and helmet are hidden in cockpit view.

- **Files:** `Assets/Models/SubaruImpreza/` and the derived `Assets/Resources/SubaruImpreza.prefab`. Embedded attribution is retained in `Source/source.json`.
- **Adaptations:** Geometry converted from the user-supplied `Impreza/subaru_impreza.glb` with Assimp; texture sizes reduced to 2K; metallic/roughness channels packed for Unity Standard materials; glass and light materials configured; vehicle scaled and aligned to the road; wheel steering and rotation pivots added. The original blue-and-gold livery is retained. The cabin shell is supplemented with the cockpit, driver, steering wheel and camera anchors from the separately credited Rally Car above.
